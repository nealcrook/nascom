keyboard of the NASCOM. For additional joy, the PS/2 keyboard supplies RESET and
(on the NASCOM 2) NMI and also a hex numeric pad.

If anyone is interested in a PCB, the price is Â£5 including postage.

To rebuild the source code from Linux (you need the SDK installed):

   $ cd nascom_multiboard/build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make

   then drag'n'drop the uf2 file to the pico.

   you can get debug output like this:

   $ minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
